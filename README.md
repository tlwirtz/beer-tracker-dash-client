# beer-tracker-dash-client
This is a client that will run on a Raspberry Pi and listen for signals from repurposed dash buttons.
This is still under heavily development. Currently the client listens for incoming signals matching a particular pattern and matches them to known dash buttons.

Future development will include methods for registering dash buttons with the client and communciation with the beer-tracker server.
